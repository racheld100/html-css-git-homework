Our assignment was to change the html and css code to be more readable and organized.

## Changing the HTML Title
* The title was changed to "Horiseon Webpage" to more accurately describe the end result that a user sees

## Adding alt attributes
* An alt attribute was added to each image so that an alternate text will be displayed if the image cannot be viewed

## Changing HTML tags/classes in the boddy
* The first div tag was changed to a header tag to better represent the block of code at the top of the page
* The second div tag in the header section was removed because it was not needed
* The class "hero" was changed to "background-image" to more accurately represent the image
* The next div tag with the class of "content" was changed to a main tag to highlight the key points of the page
* Each of the blocks of code within the class "content" was changed to a section to represent 3 different groupings, where the grouping inside each section is related.  These sections were all given the class "skills" since they look identical.
* The same was done for the blocks of code within the class "benefits
* The last div tag of the body section was changed to a footer tag to better represent the block of code at the bottom of the page

## Putting all images in HTML
* The image link for the class "hero" back ground picture was moved from CSS to HTML in order to provide an alt attribute in case the image can't be displayed

## CSS Order
* First, the CSS sections were re-ordered to better reflect the HTML code order

## Text Color/Font
* Since the majority of the text on the webpage is white, the text white function was added to the universal selector
* If the text needed to be changed later on for a specific section, a class was used to override the universal selector
* Since the majority of the text on the webpage is 'Gill Sans', the  function was added to the body section

## Condensing CSS
* The header tags were condensed where possible to be easier to read
* The "a" section was removed since there were no anchor tags in the HTML code
* The "skills" class was utilized to combine sections of the CSS code that are identical
* The "benefits" class was condensed when possible to make the code easier to read
* The text color function was added to the footer to override the default color white and change it to black
